      <p>
        I'm a junior full-stack developer based in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±,
        passionate about building modern, user-focused web applications with
        JavaScript, React, and Node.js. After completing HackYourFutureâ€™s
        7-month program, I gained real-world experience, practiced clean code,
        and learned to collaborate effectively in teams. I enjoy solving
        problems, learning continuously, and transforming ideas into functional
        digital products.
