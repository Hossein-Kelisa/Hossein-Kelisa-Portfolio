    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a junior full-stack developer based in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± with hands-on experience in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I graduated from HackYourFutureâ€™s 7-month program, where I built real-world projects, practiced clean code, and learned how to work effectively in a team.

Iâ€™m passionate about building modern, user-focused web applications that are both functional and visually clean. I enjoy solving problems, collaborating with others, and constantly improving my skills. Curious, reliable, and always ready to learn â€” I love turning ideas into real digital products.    </p>
